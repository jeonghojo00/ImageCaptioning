# Avocado Project
## Dataset
[Avocado cleaned dataset 2015-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentinjoseph/avocado-sales-20152021-us-centric)

## Questions to Answer
1. Does the price have an influence on the volume?
2. Which areas consumed avocados the most from 2015 to 2021?
3. Which size of Avocado consumed the most?
4. Does the trend in the most consuming city reflect the overall trend in the U.S.?

## Hypothesis
1. Yes. As volume goes up, the price will go up as it requires a lot of water and there may be restriction to lower the cost by simply making for farms
2. Probably California where the big tech companies emerge and people with high wage care about their healths and consume more vegetables
3. Bigger one as it may taste better
4. Yes because other cities will be also influenced by the most consuming city, otherwise staty the same if they are not influenced.
